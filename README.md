# Library-management
This project is a Book Management Application that allows users to view, update, and delete books from a collection. It is designed with a React frontend and a backend that provides APIs to interact with the book data stored in a database.

Features
View Books: Users can view a list of books along with details such as title, author, and publication year.
Delete Books: Users can delete books from the list, removing them from the database.
Update Books: Users can update the information of a book, such as the title, author, and publication year.
Technologies Used
Frontend: Built with React, using functional components and hooks for managing state and side effects.
Styling: Tailwind CSS is used to create a responsive and modern design for the user interface.
Backend: The backend is built using Node.js and Express, providing a RESTful API for interacting with the frontend.
Database: MongoDB is used to store and manage book data.
Architecture
The frontend interacts with the backend API to display book data to the user. The frontend sends HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the backend to fetch, update, or delete books.
The backend serves the frontend with book data, receives updates or deletion requests, and stores the data in the MongoDB database.
Workflow
When the application loads, it fetches the list of books from the backend and displays them on the user interface.
The user can click on a "Delete" button next to a book to remove it from the list and the database.
The user can update the details of a book, such as its title and author, using the update functionality.
Project Structure Overview
Backend Folder: Contains server setup, database configuration, API routes for managing books, and the book model.
Frontend Folder: Contains the React components that render the UI, including the BookList component that displays books and the necessary logic for interacting with the backend API.
Setup Instructions
To run this project locally, you need to install dependencies for both the frontend and backend. Ensure that you have Node.js and MongoDB installed.

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies for both the backend and frontend.
Configure your backend's database connection and environment variables.
Run the backend server and frontend application on separate ports.
Open the frontend in a browser to start interacting with the application.
API Overview
The backend provides a set of API endpoints for managing books:

GET /api/books: Fetches all books.
POST /api/books: Adds a new book to the collection.
PUT /api/books/:id: Updates an existing book's details.
DELETE /api/books/:id: Deletes a book from the collection.
